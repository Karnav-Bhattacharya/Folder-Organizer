# Folder-Organizer
Use this code to organize the messy Folder of yours...

This code was written for personal use, so if you want to use this code you might need to make some changes like adding extensions as per your convenience
or if you don't have python files in your folder you can just delete that part. If you want an another folder in it you can make one by just copying the particular lines
and use a custom name of yours and adding the extensions.

P.S: Just suit youselfðŸ˜Š
